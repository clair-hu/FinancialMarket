# Stress Tests
It is a test usually ordered by government to see how some firm will stand up to a financial crisis.

## What they would do?
* they would get information from the firm about all of their interconnectedness with other institutions, everything they own, how safe is it
* And they would look at, say for example, what would happen if there were a severe recession, or what would happen if the dollar depreciated or appreciated, or what would happen if there's a short term liquidity crisis with suddenly ability to borrow money in the short term dries up.

Usually stress test will tell you it will be okay and no problem. So the result of stress test is not trust worthy. Also company will try to whitewash the result of stress test because they do not want their customers or investors to panic and lose their trust.
